# 12 Game Programming Design Patterns with C# and the Unity Game Engine

Welcome to the repository dedicated to exploring 12 essential game programming design patterns using the C# programming language and the Unity Game Engine. This repository aims to provide comprehensive examples and explanations for each design pattern, helping game developers of all levels to understand and implement these patterns effectively in their Unity projects.

## Introduction

Design patterns are tried and tested solutions to common problems that arise during software design and development. In the context of game programming, design patterns help to organize code, improve maintainability, and promote scalability. This repository focuses on 12 fundamental game programming design patterns that can be applied using the C# programming language and integrated seamlessly with the Unity Game Engine.

## Design Patterns Covered

1. **Singleton Pattern:** Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to that instance.
2. **Factory Pattern:** Create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.
3. **Observer Pattern:** Define a dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
4. **Command Pattern:** Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with different requests, queuing of requests, and logging of the requests.
5. **State Pattern:** Allow an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes.
6. **Strategy Pattern:** Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable.
7. **Decorator Pattern:** Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically, providing a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
8. **Facade Pattern:** Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, simplifying interaction for the client.
9. **Builder Pattern:** Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.
10. **Prototype Pattern:** Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype.
11. **Chain of Responsibility Pattern:** Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request.
12. **Flyweight Pattern:** Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently.

## Getting Started

To get started with exploring the design patterns in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository using the following command:
   ```

   ```

2. Open the Unity project located in the cloned repository.

3. Navigate to the specific folders for each design pattern to find detailed explanations, code examples, and Unity scenes demonstrating the implementation of the pattern.

## Examples

Each design pattern covered in this repository includes:

- An explanation of the pattern's intent and use cases.
- UML diagrams illustrating the structure of the pattern.
- Code examples demonstrating how to implement the pattern in C# and Unity.
- Unity scenes showcasing the pattern's practical application in a game context.
